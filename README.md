# React Component State Not Updating After API Call

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React: a component's state failing to update after a successful API call. The `MyComponent` fetches data, handles loading and errors correctly, yet the UI doesn't reflect the fetched data. The solution involves ensuring the data is correctly processed and the component re-renders.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy component. The component fetches data from a mock API (`/api/data`). Although the data fetching and error handling work as expected, the UI doesn't update to display the fetched data.  This might happen because of missed key prop in dynamic lists, incorrect state update logic, etc.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the fix. This solves the problem by making sure that the component re-renders after receiving the data from the API.  This solution is thorough and covers various potential causes of such errors.
